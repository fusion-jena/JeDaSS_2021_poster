# Towards Scientific Data Synthesis Using Deep Learning and Semantic Web

# Abstract
One of the added values of long-running and large-scale collaborative projects is the ability to answer complex research questions based on the comprehensive set of data provided by their central repositories. In practice, however, finding data in such a repository to answer a specific question often proves to be a demanding task even for project scientists. In this paper, we aim to ease this task, thereby enabling cross-cutting analyses. To achieve that we introduce a new data analysis and summarization approach combining semantic web and machine learning approaches. In particular, the proposed approach makes use of the capability of machine learning to categorize a given dataset into a domain topic and to extract hidden links between its data attributes and data attributes from other datasets. The proposed approach has been developed in the frame of CRC AquaDivaand has been applied to its datasets..

The project collaborates closely with other initiatives that work on mapping and organizing scientific knowledge, such as the [hi-knowledge](https://hi-knowledge.org/) project.

Our interdisciplinary team brings together people from Natural Language Processing, Biology, Semantic Web and Knowledge Representation. This is us:
